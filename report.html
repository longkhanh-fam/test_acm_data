<p>Caption 2: A viral meme got key facts wrong while attempting to make a point about police violence and racial injustice in the U.S.</p>
<p>Context 2: The viral meme in question is a photo of a woman with the caption, "I was also murdered by a police officer, where was my riot?" The intention behind this meme is to raise awareness about police violence and racial injustice in the United States. However, there are some key factual errors in the meme. Firstly, the woman in the photo is not a victim of police violence, as she is merely posing for the picture. Secondly, the meme implies that the woman was involved in a riot, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The meme has gone viral, but it is important to note that the message it conveys is based on inaccurate information. It is essential to ensure that such messages are based on accurate facts and well-researched data to effectively convey the intended message and raise awareness about the issues they aim to address.</p>

<p>Context 1: This statement is false and misleading. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are two separate agencies with distinct roles and responsibilities. The CDC is a public health agency focused on protecting the health and well-being of Americans, while the FBI is a law enforcement agency responsible for investigating criminal activities. The two agencies do not typically work together on the same projects or share data related to health and criminal investigations. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that the CDC is involved in any cover-up or conspiracy related to vaccines and autism.</p>

However, the claims that the FBI "raided" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the middle of the night for data on vaccines and autism, as purported by the hoax purveyor, are false. The CDC is an independent agency of the United States government and is not part of the FBI's jurisdiction or responsibilities.

These shirts are a reference to the slogan "I Can't Breathe" that emerged in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a police officer in 2014. The officers' choice to wear these shirts mocking the original slogan has caused controversy and criticism, as it appears to be disrespectful to the memory of the man who died under questionable circumstances.

<p>Context 1: The image shows a man in a red and black outfit, likely a Maasai warrior, performing a traditional dance. The Maasai tribe has a rich cultural heritage and are known for their colorful attire. It is true that the Kenyan government has used the Maasai tribe for curfew purposes, as a way to enforce safety measures and maintain order in the area. However, it is important to note that this was done in response to people not taking the police seriously and not as a means of exploiting the tribe.

This scene showcases the impressive technology and capabilities of the USS Gerald Ford and the United States Navy, allowing them to launch vehicles, such as trucks, from their ships to support various missions and operations.</p>
<p>Caption 2: The viral Facebook video suggests that the Navy was being wasteful, as these “trucks” were lost and left to decay in the water. But that’s not always the case. These tests were conducted in the relatively shallow waters of the James River (as opposed to the ocean) and can usually be retrieved for additional tests.</p>
<p>Context 2: The image shows a large naval ship with several smaller boats floating in the water. The presence of these boats in the water is not necessarily a sign of wastefulness. They could be part of the ship's complement of smaller vessels, which are used for various purposes such as transportation, patrol, or training. Additionally, these boats might have been temporarily left in the water for maintenance, refueling, or other operational reasons.

<p>Context 2: The image shows a man holding a syringe, which is associated with drug use, particularly heroin. The confusion arises from the caption, which states that New York state had legalized heroin. However, this is not true. The state of New York has not legalized heroin use. Instead, there is a proposal to allow addicts to use heroin under medical supervision, which is different from legalizing the drug. The satire site's article may have misinterpreted or misreported this proposal, leading to the confusion in the image's context.</p>

Supporters argue that the campaign has led to a significant decrease in drug-related violence and drug consumption, while opponents contend that it has had limited impact and has resulted in numerous human rights violations.The arrest and imprisonment of high-profile figures like Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, who was recently extradited to the United States, is often cited as a success in the war on drugs. However, critics argue that these arrests do not necessarily mean the end of the drug trade, as they merely replace one cartel with another. Furthermore, the crackdown on drug trafficking has led to an increase in violence and insecurity, as rival cartels fight for control of the lucrative drug routes.In addition, the use of controversial tactics like torture and extrajudicial killings by security forces has been condemned by human rights organizations, leading to accusations of abuse and corruption within the government.In conclusion, the war on drugs in Mexico has been a complex and contentious issue, with opinions divided on its effectiveness</p>

<p>Context 1: During his unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent a significant amount on advertisements. If he had given each American $1 million, he would have distributed $310,614,200,000 (assuming the average American household has 2.6 people). This amount is equivalent to the total amount of money Bloomberg spent on advertisements during his campaign. However, it is important to note that this calculation does not take into account the various costs associated with running a presidential campaign, such as staff, office space, and other expenses.</p>
<p>Caption 2: If Bloomberg were to divide his wealth equally among the American population, each person would receive less than $200.</p>
<p>Context 2: Based on the current wealth of Michael Bloomberg, if he were to divide his wealth equally among the American population, each person would receive less than $200. This is because Bloomberg is one of the richest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of $68.7 billion as of September 2021, according to Forbes. Dividing his wealth evenly among the 329 million people in the United States would result in each person receiving less than $200. However, it is important to note that this calculation does not take into account taxes and other factors that could reduce the actual payout to individuals.</p>

<p>Caption 2: It isn’t unprecedented for birds and dogs to strike up friendships, thus claim is false</p>
<p>Context 2: The claim that two birds, a goose and a duck, are friends with a dog is not entirely false. It is possible for different bird species to form bonds with other animals, including dogs. However, the image provided does not show any evidence of such a friendship. The image only shows a goose and a duck sitting next to each other, with a dog in the background. The presence of the dog in the image does not necessarily indicate a friendship between the birds and the dog. The claim could be considered false based on the lack of evidence presented in the image.</p>

<p>Context 1: In the United States, it is not necessary to refrigerate eggs. They can be stored at room temperature, as long as the egg shells are not cracked. However, it is important to keep them away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and humidity to prevent spoilage and maintain their freshness. The decision to refrigerate eggs can vary depending on the country or region, so it is essential to check local food storage guidelines for the most accurate information.</p>
<p>Caption 2: The FDA has strongly advised that people living in the United States should keep their eggs refrigerated.</p>
<p>Context 2: The FDA has issued a recommendation that people living in the United States should keep their eggs refrigerated. This recommendation is based on food safety guidelines and helps to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella, which can be present in eggs.

<p>Caption 1: The California Legislature has passed a controversial Assembly Bill that creates a ban on the future sale and ownership of all .45 ACP ammo.</p>
<p>Context 1: The California Legislature has passed a controversial Assembly Bill that creates a ban on the future sale and ownership of all .45 ACP ammo. This bill, if signed into law, would make it illegal for individuals to purchase or possess ammunition for the .45 ACP caliber handgun in the state of California. The bill aims to reduce gun violence, but critics argue that it infringes on the rights of law-abiding gun owners and could lead to unintended consequences. The measure now awaits the governor's signature before it can take effect.</p>
<p>Caption 2: No, California has not banned a popular type of ammunition.</p>
<p>Context 2: There is a widespread misconception that California has banned the use of hollow-point ammunition. This is incorrect. California does not have any laws or regulations that specifically ban the use of hollow-point ammunition for firearms. The state only requires that ammunition sold within its borders meet minimum standards for safety and performance. This includes using non-explosive bullet cores and appropriate muzzle velocities. However, some local jurisdictions may have restrictions on the use of hollow-point ammunition for specific purposes, such as hunting or target shooting, so it is always a good idea to check local regulations.</p>

The band the Sex Pistols was formed in the United Kingdom, and their music and lyrics were often critical of the political and social systems in place. It is unlikely that they were part of a covert operation organized by the KGB.</p>

<p>Context 1: If President Trump were to leave office early, as speculated in some media reports, Nancy Pelosi would become the Vice President of the United States. As the Speaker of the House, Pelosi is next in line to the presidency after the Vice President, Mike Pence. If Pence were to become the President, Pelosi would automatically assume the role of Vice President. It is important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario and has not happened yet.</p>
<p>Caption 2: A vacancy in the vice presidency is filled by the president, the claim that Pelosi would, de facto, become vice president if Mike Pence were elevated to president is therefore “False.”</p>
<p>Context 2: The claim that Nancy Pelosi would, de facto, become vice president if Mike Pence were elevated to president is not accurate. The United States Constitution specifies that the Vice President of the United States is elected separately from the President and serves as the President of the Senate, among other duties. The Vice President is not automatically elevated to the presidency if the President is removed from office. Rather, the President of the Senate, currently Vice President Mike Pence, would assume the role of Acting President until an election can be held to fill the vacancy. Additionally, the 25th Amendment to the Constitution provides a process for removing a President who is unable to discharge their duties, but it does not automatically elevate the Vice President to the presidency.</p>

<p>Caption 1: Backless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016.</p>
<p>Context 1: The backless booster seats, also known as high chairs, will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016. This ban is a result of a regulation passed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in an effort to improve child safety in vehicles. The ban applies to booster seats that do not have a back or do not meet the minimum height and weight requirements set by the NHTSA. This change in regulation is aimed at reducing the risk of injury to children in case of a crash and ensuring that they are properly restrained while in a car. Manufacturers of booster seats will have to comply with the new regulations, and parents will need to switch to backless booster seats that meet the new standards or consider using a vehicle's built-in child restraint system.</p>
<p>Caption 2: Parents who continue to put their children in booster cushions can continue to do so without breaking any laws in the UK.</p>
<p>Context 2: In the UK, there are no specific laws requiring parents to use booster cushions or seat belts for children in cars. However, it is recommended by the UK's Department for Transport (DfT) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that children should use appropriate child restraints, such as booster cushions or child seats, to ensure their safety while traveling in cars. The use of child restraints can reduce the risk of injury in case of an accident. It is also important for parents to ensure that the restraints are properly installed and used according to the manufacturer's instructions and guidelines.</p>

<p>Context 1: While it is true that President Trump was not directly "acquitted" of the articles of impeachment brought by the U.S. House of Representatives, he did not receive a conviction either. The impeachment process in the United States involves a trial in the U.S. Senate, where the Chief Justice presides over the proceedings.

As a result, President Trump remains in office, and the impeachment process does not result in removal from office. The impeachment process is a political process, and the outcome is ultimately determined by the votes of the senators, who are members of the political party of the President.</p>

The extensive subway network and limited parking in Chongqing are hindering car sales in the city. This suggests that the public transportation system is well-developed and efficient, which may discourage residents from purchasing cars. As a result, the demand for cars in Chongqing is lower, and car dealerships may face challenges in selling vehicles. This could also lead to a decrease in the number of car dealerships in the city, as the market for car sales is not as profitable as it would be in other cities with a lower public transportation system and more available parking spaces.</p>

<p>Caption 1: Would Nancy Pelosi Become Vice President If Trump Left Office Early?</p>
<p>Context 1: No, Nancy Pelosi would not automatically become the Vice President if Donald Trump left office early. The Vice President is not directly elected by the people and instead is elected by an Electoral College vote. In the case of the Vice President's office becoming vacant, the President of the Senate, who is currently Vice President Joe Biden, would assume the role of Acting President until a new Vice President is elected by the Electoral College. The President of the Senate is responsible for breaking ties in the Senate, but they do not have significant executive powers.</p>
<p>Caption 2: A vacancy in the vice presidency is filled by the president, the claim that Pelosi would, de facto, become vice president if Mike Pence were elevated to president is therefore “False.”</p>
<p>Context 2: The claim that Nancy Pelosi would, de facto, become vice president if Mike Pence were elevated to president is not accurate. The United States Constitution specifies that the Vice President of the United States is elected separately from the President, and the two offices are not interchangeable. The Vice President is not automatically elevated to the presidency in case of the President's death, resignation, or removal from office. Rather, the Vice President becomes the President upon the President's removal or death. Additionally, the Vice President has specific powers and responsibilities, including presiding over the Senate, being a member of the Cabinet, and serving as the nation's chief diplomat. Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House, not the Vice President, and her role and responsibilities are different from those of the Vice President.</p>

<p>Context 1: The Golden Gate Bridge is a famous suspension bridge that spans the Golden Gate, the entrance to the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. It opened to the public for the first time on May 27, 1937. The bridge was originally designed to withstand a load of 2,000 pounds per square inch (13,000 N/sq m), but it came close to collapsing due to the weight of the crowd that gathered to celebrate its opening. On that day, an estimated 200,000 people crossed the bridge, causing it to bend and sway significantly. Fortunately, the bridge did not collapse, and it has since been retrofitted to withstand heavier loads.</p>

<p>Context 1: As of December 2016, it will be illegal to use a backless booster seat with a child under the age of 12 in the United Kingdom. This change in law is being introduced to improve child safety in cars, as backless booster seats do not provide the same level of protection as high-backed booster seats or child seats. The new regulation aims to reduce the risk of injury in the event of a crash and ensure that children are seated in an appropriate and secure manner.</p>
<p>Caption 2: Parents who continue to put their children in booster cushions can continue to do so without breaking any laws in the UK.</p>
<p>Context 2: In the UK, there is no specific law that requires parents or caregivers to use booster cushions or seat belts for children in cars. However, it is recommended by the UK's Department for Transport (DfT) and road safety organizations to use appropriate child restraints, such as booster cushions or child seats, to ensure the safety of children during car journeys. The use of booster cushions or seat belts can help prevent injuries in case of an accident or sudden braking. It is essential for parents to choose the right child restraint for their child's age, weight, and height, and to always secure the child properly. The DfT and road safety organizations provide guidelines and recommendations to help parents make informed decisions about their child's safety while traveling in a car.</p>

The law requires that children must be secured in a booster seat with a harness or a combination lap and shoulder belt to ensure their safety while in a car. This is because backless booster seats do not provide the necessary support and protection for children during car accidents, increasing the risk of injury.

<p>Caption 2: Parents who continue to put their children in booster cushions can continue to do so without breaking any laws in the UK.</p>
<p>Context 2: In the UK, there is no specific law requiring parents to use car seats or booster cushions for children. However, it is recommended by the UK's Department for Transport (DfT) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that children should use appropriate child restraints, such as car seats or booster cushions, for their age and size, to ensure their safety while traveling in a car. The DfT and NICE guidelines suggest that children should use a car seat until they are 12 years old or 135 centimeters tall, and then transition to a booster cushion or seatbelt. It is also important to ensure that the car seat or booster cushion is correctly installed and fits the child correctly. Parents can consult the manufacturer's instructions or seek advice from a road safety officer or child car seat expert for guidance on selecting and installing the appropriate child restraint for their child.</p>

<p>Caption 1: Under former U.S. President Donald Trump, Congress passed a law that gives outgoing presidential administrations control of American armed forces after Inauguration Day, for up to 60 days.</p>
<p>Context 1: Under former U.S. President Donald Trump, Congress passed a law that grants outgoing presidential administrations control of American armed forces for a period of up to 60 days after Inauguration Day. This provision, known as the 60-day period, allows the new president and their team to review and assess the military situation, make any necessary changes, and establish their own strategies and policies. The 60-day period expires on the date of the new president's inauguration, and the incoming president assumes full control of the military. This law was enacted to ensure a smooth transition between administrations and to avoid any disruptions or conflicts in military operations during the transition period.</p>
<p>Caption 2: While it was true that Congress, under Trump, established a law that requires the GSA to provide services to outgoing presidents for up to 60 days after Inauguration Day, the legislation did not give those politicians or their administrations the authority to direct any federal department, including the armed forces, after their successor takes office.</p>
<p>Context 2: In the image, President Trump is pointing at a group of military officers, but he does not have the authority to directly order the armed forces after his inauguration. The authority to direct the military comes from the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The legislation passed by Congress during Trump's presidency only grants the outgoing President access to certain services provided by the General Services Administration (GSA) for a limited time after Inauguration Day, but it does not give the President the authority to control the military or any other federal department.</p>

<p>Context 2: Scientists studying whale songs have suggested that there may be other reasons for the music shared among these giants beyond finding mates. One possibility is that whale songs serve as a form of communication, allowing whales to convey information about their location, social status, and even warnings about potential threats. Another theory is that whale songs may be a form of cultural expression, with different songs being passed down through generations and used to create unique identities within a whale community. The complex patterns and melodies found in whale songs may also serve as a form of cognitive enrichment, helping whales develop and maintain memory and learning skills.</p>

<p>Caption 1: A house is the biggest asset that most families own. If middle class families can pay an annual tax on their main source of wealth, wealthy families can, too, says David Leonhardt.</p>
<p>Context 1: In the image, there is a real estate sign in front of a house, indicating that the property is for sale. The house is a large, two-story structure with a porch, and it appears to be well-maintained. The presence of the real estate sign suggests that the owners are attempting to sell the property, and they are likely looking to make a profit. However, the idea of a wealth tax, as suggested by David Leonhardt, is not a common practice in most countries. A wealth tax is a tax levied on the net worth of individuals or families, with the aim of redistributing wealth and reducing income inequality. This tax is not commonly implemented, as it raises concerns about its practicality, fairness, and potential unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Caption 2: A for sale sign stands in front of a house, in Jenkintown, Pa., Friday, June 8, 2018.</p>
<p>Context 2: The image features a white two-story house with a "For Sale" sign prominently displayed in front of it. The sign is placed on a grassy area, and the house appears to be well-maintained.

The presence of these vehicles suggests that the house might be in a residential area where people are likely to have their cars parked nearby.</p>

<p>Context 2: The viral meme in question is a photo of a woman with the caption, "I was also murdered by a police officer, where was my riot?" The meme is attempting to make a point about police violence and racial injustice in the U.S. However, it gets key facts wrong by implying that the woman in the photo was killed by a police officer. In reality, the woman in the photo is not dead, and there is no evidence to suggest that she was killed by a police officer. The meme's misinformation and inaccurate portrayal of the woman's situation can be harmful and distract from the important conversation about police violence and racial injustice.</p>

The long-term consequences of coral bleaching can be devastating for coral reef ecosystems, as they are crucial habitats for marine life and provide valuable services such as coastal protection and carbon sequestration. It is essential to address the causes of ocean warming and climate change to mitigate the impacts of coral bleaching and protect these vital ecosystems.</p>
